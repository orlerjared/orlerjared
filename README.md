- Hi, I'm Jared
- I'm interested in learning web development. I'm learning everything via courses on Udemy.com. I have a solid understanding of HTML, and a pretty good understading of regular CSS.  I'm comfortable with the basics of vanilla JavaScript as well.  I'm currently learning React.js and will be moving onto Next.js as soon as I complete the current course that I'm enrolled in.
- I'm willing to collaborate on anything. I understand my limitations as a web developer at this time, and only ask that those who are wanting to collaborate understand the same thing.
- I can be reached at orlerjared@gmail.com.  Please reference GitHub in the subject.
